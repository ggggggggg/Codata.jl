Codata.jl provides an interface to the presently accepted CODATA list of fundamental constants
as published by NIST in Julia.  The code in the Codata.jl module is automatically generated by
the code in the Generate.jl file, and should not be modified and can be used as-is.  As the NIST
tables are updated, Generate.jl can be used to re-generate the Codata.jl file in lockstep.

To access the value of a constant, simply load the Codata module, and then to access e.g. the value
of the electron mass:  

e_mass = CODATA.electron_mass.value  

That's it!  Currently 335 constants are defined in the file.
